INFOTC 2040 Csharp Questions 1 Challenge

1. **Q:** What is a namespace? **A:** A namespace is a way to organize your project.

2. **Q:** What are value types? **A:** Value types is a data type that can be assigned a direct value. Examples are int, char, float, double, long, and bool.

3. **Q:** What are reference types? **A:** Reference types is a data type that does not contain data, but rather they reference to variables. Object, dynamic, and string are built in reference types.

4. **Q:** What is an automatic property and how is it useful? **A:** It's basically a shortcut for programmers. It's used when no additional logic is needed in property accessors.

5. **Q:** What is the purpose of the **using** statement? **A:** They call for the dispose method on the object in the correct way.

6. **Q:** What are dynamic type variables? **A:** Variables that can be changed or unknown at runtime.

7. **Q:** What is the purpose of the **is** operator? **A:** It determines if an object instance or expression result can be changed to a specified type.

8. **Q:** What are generics and how is using them useful? **A:** Generics is a class which lets the user define classes and methods with placeholder. It allows for type-safe data structures.

9. **Q:** What is the scope of a public member of a class? **A:** It can accessed during the whole runtime.

10. **Q:** Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments? **A:** Yes

11. **Q:** How do you sort an array? **A:** One possible way is to use method Array.Sort() then include a parameter.

12. **Q:** What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve? **A:** It allows one to assign null as a value to type variables.

13. **Q:** What is an enumeration? **A:** Enum is a set of named integer constants.

14. **Q:** What is inheritance? **A:** It allows one to make a class in terms of another class, an easier way to make classes.

15. **Q:** Is multiple inheritance supported? **A:** No.

16. **Q:** What is the purpose of as operator? **A:** It tells the compiler to perform a certain operation.

17. **Q:** What is an object? **A:** An instance of a class that is created dynamically.

18. **Q:** What is the difference between a struct and a class? **A:** Structs contain value types while classes are reference types.

19. **Q:** What is the difference between **continue** and **break** statements? **A:** Break will stop the loop or switch while continue skips one or more statements in a loop or switch then moves to the next iteration.

20. **Q:** What is **this** and how is it used? **A:** It refers to a current instance of a class. Used as a modifier in the first parameter.

21. **Q:** What is **try** and **catch** and when are they used? **A:** Try runs a block of code that may cause an exception and catch is there to handle the exception.

22. **Q:** How is exception handling done? **A:** With catch.

23. **Q:** What is **finally** and what is its purpose? **A:** Finally is a code that executes after try and catch. The purpose is to release the system resources.

24. **Q:** List the differences between Array and ArrayList. **A:** Array is static nature while ArrayList is dynamic nature.

25. **Q:** What is an object? **A:** An instance of a class that is created dynamically.

26. **Q:** Define **constructor**. **A:** A constructor is a special method of the class that is automatically invoked when a instance of a class is made.

27. **Q:** When can **var** be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined? **A:** Can be declared at method scope and the compiler will determine the type.

28. **Q:** What is an abstract class? **A:** Class with a blueprint for derived classes.

29. **Q:** What is an interface? **A:** declares the property and methods used in the child class.

30. **Q:** What is a method? **A:** A group of statements that work together to run a task.

31. **Q:** What is a property? **A:** A member that provides a flexible tools to read and write the value of a private field.

32. **Q:** What is an access specifier? **A:** Keywords that help specify accessibility of a type and its members.

33. **Q:** What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean? **A:** **Private:** Limits the accessibility of a member to within the defined type. **Public:** Has no limits on accessibility. **Internal:** When class members are accessible within the assembly. **Protected:** When inheritance is used. **Protected Internal:** Combination of protected and internal.

34. **Q:** What is a collection? **A:** The way which objects are handled in the program.

35. **Q:** What is a Hash Table? **A:** Representation of a collection of key and value pairs that are organized based on hash code of the key.
